# portfolio-site

This was my fourth project and my most complete frontend build to date. After working on smaller, focused tools like my password generator and pixel art editor, I wanted to bring everything together into a portfolio that could represent both my skills and personal style.

The goal was to create a clean, responsive site that acts as a central hub for my work. I focused on writing accessible, semantic HTML, combining it with consistent CSS and light visual effects. I also explored design elements inspired by older operating systems, while keeping everything modern and usable on both desktop and mobile.

## Features

- Fully responsive multi-page layout
- Custom styling with local fonts and consistent color scheme
- Clear, semantic structure for readability and maintainability
- Styled header, footer, navigation, and content sections
- Built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no frameworks

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Why This Project Matters

This project brought together everything Iâ€™d learned in the three previous builds. It gave me the chance to think about layout across multiple pages, apply consistent design principles, and structure content in a way that feels intuitive to users. It also helped me get more comfortable with styling and visual structure, both of which were important in preparing for public-facing developer roles.

## Future Improvements

- Add animation effects to sections and navigation
- Include filtering or sorting features for projects
- Add a light/dark mode toggle
- Convert the site into a Progressive Web App
- Refactor into subroutines for better scalability
