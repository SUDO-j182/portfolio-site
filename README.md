# portfolio-site

This was my fourth project and my most complete frontend build to date. After working on smaller, focused tools like my password generator and pixel art editor, I wanted to bring everything together into a portfolio that could represent both my skills and personal style.

The goal was to create a clean, responsive site that acts as a central hub for my work. I focused on writing accessible, semantic HTML, combining it with consistent CSS and light visual effects. I also explored design elements inspired by older operating systems, while keeping everything modern and usable on both desktop and mobile.

## Features

- Fully responsive multi-page layout
- Custom styling with local fonts and consistent color scheme
- Clear, semantic structure for readability and maintainability
- Styled header, footer, navigation, and content sections
- Built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no frameworks

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Why This Project Matters

This project brought together everything I’d learned in the three previous builds. It gave me the chance to think about layout across multiple pages, apply consistent design principles, and structure content in a way that feels intuitive to users. It also helped me get more comfortable with styling and visual structure, both of which were important in preparing for public-facing developer roles. 

Later the webiste evolved into a more responsive and mobile friendly variation, featuring a single page layout and modern design. 

## Future Improvements

- Add animation effects to sections and navigation
- Include filtering or sorting features for projects
- Add a light/dark mode toggle
- Convert the site into a Progressive Web App
- Refactor into subroutines for better scalability
- Refactor HTML content
